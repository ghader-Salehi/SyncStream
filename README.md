# SyncStream

SyncStream is a platform that enables users to watch videos in sync across multiple 
devices. When one device user plays, pauses, or forwards the video, these actions 
occur simultaneously on all connected devices in real-time. It provides an online 
cinema-like experience, making it easy to enjoy videos with friends.
